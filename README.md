```

### Step 2: Include the Handler in Your Project:

```

### Step 3: Configure Your `.htaccess` File

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the 'SweetUrlHandler' class in your project:
```php
require_once 'src/SweetUrlHandler.php';

$handler = new SweetUrlHandler();

// Get the entire route as an array
$route = $handler->getRoute();
echo 'Current Route: ' . implode('/', $route);

// Get a specific segment of the route
$segment = $handler->getRoute(0); // First segment
echo 'First Segment: ' . $segment;

```

## Advanced Usage
### Route Matching
You can match specific routes using patterns. This allows you to define routes with parameters, making your URL handling more dynamic:
```php
require_once 'src/SweetUrlHandler.php';

$handler = new SweetUrlHandler();

// Example: Match a route like /products/123
$match = $handler->matchRoute('products/{id}');
if ($match) {
    echo 'Product ID: ' . $match['id'];
} else {
    echo 'No match found';
}
```
